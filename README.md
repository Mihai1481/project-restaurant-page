This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) curriculum, specifically the JavaScript section. The goal was to create a dynamic restaurant webpage using fundamental concepts of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

This project implements a simple restaurant webpage where users can navigate between different sections: Home, Menu, and Contact.

### The page features:
- Dynamic content loading for seamless navigation between sections without reloading the page.
- A clean and minimalist design for an intuitive user experience.
- Modular JavaScript code for maintainability and scalability.

To complete this project, I had to:

### Build the user interface:
- Designed the Home, Menu, and Contact sections using HTML and CSS with a cohesive theme.
- Added a navigation bar for switching between sections dynamically.

### Apply JavaScript concepts:
- Organized the code using JavaScript modules to separate concerns.
- Used DOM manipulation to dynamically display content based on the selected section.
- Implemented navigation functionality without reloading the page.

## Lessons Learned:

- How to effectively manipulate the DOM using JavaScript for dynamic content updates.
- The importance of modular code to improve readability and reusability.
- Configuring and utilizing Webpack for bundling and managing project dependencies.
